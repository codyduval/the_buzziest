<strong>Phone:</strong> 212-466-0404<br />
<strong>Web:</strong> <a href="http://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com/rests_beer_garden_main.htm">blueribbonrestaurants.com</a><br />
<strong>Status:</strong> Certified Open</p>

<p>The latest venture from <strong>Eric and Bruce Bromberg</strong>, the brothers behind the <a href="http://ny.eater.com/tags/blue-ribbon">Blue Ribbon</a> family of restaurants and late-night hangouts, is <strong>Blue Ribbon Beer Garden</strong>. It's now open on the second floor terrace of 190 Thompson Street on the Lower East Side, in the <a href="http://ny.curbed.com/tags/thompson-les">Thompson LES</a> boutique hotel. </p>

<p>This place <a href="http://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com/pdf/beerGardenMenu.pdf">has everything</a>: barbecue and Cornish game hen, local beers like Brooklyn Lager and Sixpoint Sweet Action, large-format beers like Saison Dupont and Brooklyn Sorachi Acew, <strong>ping pong and board games</strong>, and an all-weather tent to keep the party going rain or shine. In addition to the barbecue plates&#151;all of which come with beans, coleslaw, and corn bread for $15&#151;the beer garden has a selection of snacks like boiled peanuts and pork rinds for just $3.</p>

<p>Blue Ribbon Beer Garden serves until 10 p.m. nightly, opening up at 5 p.m. on weeknights and at noon on weekdays. And this isn't the only 2013 expansion for the Bromberg boys. Later this summer they will open their <a href="http://ny.eater.com/tags/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken">fried chicken restaurant</a> in the East Village, serving perhaps their most popular dish at the corner of Second Avenue and East First Street. </p>

In two years there have been two festivals, both marred by notable difficulties.  Is it really possible that no one planning the outdoor event checked the forecast for Sunday and wondered what the consequences of a modest rain shower might be?  Were there successes achieved as well as disappointments?  To gain a little perspective, Eater reached out to two-year festival veteran <b>Carla Rzeszewski</b>, the Wine Director of The Breslin, The John Dory Oyster Bar, and The Spotted Pig.  What did she think of her GoogaMooga experience?</p>

<p><b>How did you get involved with the GoogaMooga last year?</b><br />
Actually it was Paul Grieco who contacted me first.  Paul emailed me and he said, "Hey, there is this festival going on and Peter Eastlake and I want you to be a part of it.  You can do whatever you want."  I hadn't heard about it and I had no idea what it was.  I was like, "What kind of festival?  Who is the audience?  What is the scale of this thing?"  They responded back and they said, "This has never been done.  It is going to be the music of Bonnaroo, but bending it more towards the foodie culture in New York." Although, I think it would be applicable to other cities, and I have heard they might be looking at doing it in Chicago, which would be dope as hell.  But anyway, they said, "You can do anything you want, we just want you to be a part of it." And I said, "Awesome, I want to do sherry." And they were like, "Yeah that would be great."  So Paul was kind of the person who wrangled the wine people last year, and this year it was Tanner Walle, also of Hearth and Terroir.  And I had known both of them from working with them before.<br />
</p>]]>
		<![CDATA[<p><b>How did it go in the planning stages last year?</b><br />
We got to sit down in a round table discussion and just sort of break down what the plan was for the wine tent.  They were gracious enough to give me a booth and say, "Hey, do what you want."  So I chose six sherries, and I did all Fino and Manzanilla.  And then I flipped out literally the day before GoogaMooga last year.  I was like, "Carla, what have you chosen to do?  What are you doing pouring dry sherry at a music festival?  No one is going to come and buy this, and you are responsible."  So I was like, "I know what will convince people about these wines: they need to have food alongside them."  Then I very last minute contacted Peter, and I said, "Peter, I need olives and I need almonds, can we do this?"  And he said, "Carla, if you think it is going to work, yes."  And it did work.</p>

<p><b>So you felt the GoogaMooga staff were supportive of what you wanted to do?</b><br />
For sure.  Amazingly supportive.  Peter was like, "I don't know if this is going to be allowed in terms of the rules, because this is the wine tent, not the food tent, but you know what, fuck it. If you think it is important, let's just do it.  We'll make it happen."  He was awesome from the get-go, and totally open to feedback.  Him and Jonathan Mayers.  I've sat down with them both and the question has been, "How can we make this fantastic?  How can we make this better than before?"  They are not at all stuck in an idea of how it needs to be, and they are encouraging of new ideas.  Peter called me this year, and he said, "Hey, do you want to be on one of these trading cards?"  And I was like, "Yeah, let's do it!"  So I go in to have my photo taken, and I was blown away by the level of invention and fun imagination in their office.  The way that ideas were being tossed around, there was a childlike freedom that you rarely find.</p>

<p><b>What do you think about some of the problems that have come up in the two years that the event has been held?</b><br />
It is a shame what happened the first year with the cell phone towers going down and the food shortages.  And this year with the rain.  There have been obstacles, but there are adjustments that can be made.  I think that what was faulty last year was addressed this year, and unfortunately some other stuff also came up.</p>

<p><b>Did they ever say anything to you regarding what would happen if it rained?</b><br />
No.</p>

<p><b>The event added an extra day this year compared to last year, right?</b><br />
It was two days last year and three days this year.  And I think that speaks to the power of a festival like this.  This year we did sherry again, and I had people come up to the table and say, "Oh my god, I loved your sherry last year!  I had no idea what it was, but now I drink it all the time.  I was hoping you were going to be here this year!"  There was a good amount of love.  The general awareness of sherry has grown in the last year.  Even I was surprised by how widespread the awareness has become compared to last year.  There were people there asking for specific wines this year.  Specific sherries.  And people kept coming up and saying, "Thank you for doing this."  For sherry to be a highlight of this festival I think is pretty admirable.  They aren't trying to pander to a preexisting notion of what their consumers want.  Instead they are letting the wine people talk about what they are excited about and trusting that that will translate to the audience.  I think that is huge.</p>

<p><b>There has been some criticism leveled at GoogaMooga for offering again what is already offered every day in New York, without adding anything to that.  But are you saying that what they are doing is allowing for exciting aspects of a restaurant to be showcased, where those elements might get less notice inside the normal day to day operation?</b><br />
I think that GoogaMooga allowing the wine people to choose what they want to talk about and support is a brave move.  They could just choose something popular for us.  But instead they made partners in the wine community to help dream it up.  They are allowing us into the process, and that's important.  Sure, there are tables that come into our restaurants and ask for sherry, but that's not the majority.  And for me to be able to stand behind a booth and walk people through it, to share that, I was grateful.  Usually if you have one or two tables a night that want that, you are lucky.  So for me to be able to do that for hundreds of people was a huge gift.  I couldn't have been happier.  And in terms of the food, there were special items offered that you don't see at the restaurants already.  The Spotted Pig was doing foot long sausages that are not on the menu at any of our restaurants.  There was a spin on the idea of what April does.  And it wasn't the burger that it was last year.  It was, "Hey, come and see what we are up to this year," and on a day that there is live music.  </p>

<p><b>So walk me through what happened on Sunday.  What was the timeline?</b><br />
When we figured out that the festival wasn't going to happen we were bummed.  I got a text saying it was shut down as I walked in.  Everybody was just sort of standing around.  The vibe was like, damn, we would have liked to have done this.  Walking around seeing all the food that was being wasted was weird.  Eerily apocalyptic.  One chef told me that she had been smoking a lamb for two days, and now she had to figure out a way to use it.  Talking to Tanner and Peter later on that day, they were bummed.  But they had already begun getting the food to the foodbanks.  I know that Salvation Taco brought food out to the Rockaways.  So somebody benefited, but maybe not the vendors.  The question was how to give the food back to the community so that it wasn't being wasted.</p>

<p><b>In terms of value to vendors, have you seen people come into the restaurants you work at and recognize you from the festival?</b><br />
For sure.  I had people coming up to the table and saying, "Oh, I have your trading card right here.  This is where you work?  Okay."  That can only help the restaurant and me.  People know where to come.</p>

<p>Apparently owners Howard Hunt and Susan Surdacki let their <a href="http://www.trans.abc.state.ny.us/servlet/ApplicationServlet?pageName=com.ibm.nysla.data.publicquery.PublicQuerySuccessfulResultsPage&validated=true&serialNumber=1160010&licenseType=OP">liquor license expire last month </a>and stopped operating as of this week without telling anyone why. They had run the Levee since 2005, in the same location that once housed the <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/kokies-v15n1">infamous narcotics friendly bar Kokie's </a>in the late 90s and earlier part of the new century. Eater has called the bar looking for comment but no one answered. </p>

<p>Maybe Williamsburg is only good for <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/05/verboten_opening_new_mega_dance_club_in_williamsburg.php">mega dance clubs now or something</a>.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b>: The owners of The Levee <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10152829281670304&id=337840215303">just posted the following message on the bar's Facebook Page</a>: "Hey, friends. We're fine. Our paperwork for our license renewal never made it to the SLA, so we're playing it safe and staying closed until our new license comes in. We're gonna take this next month to make some much needed improvements to the bar, and hopefully be back better than ever. Thanks for the outrage and love and support!"  <br />

<strong>Status:</strong> <em>Open</em></p>

<p>Last week <strong>Zak Pelaccio's</strong> newest venture, <strong>Fish & Game</strong>, opened up the river in Hudson, NY. The restaurant is housed in a 19th century blacksmith shop in the old rural town, and marks a departure for Pelaccio not only from Manhattan, but also from his <strong>Fatty Crew</strong> empire. The restaurant's interior keeps the rustic look of the blacksmith shop, with plenty of stone walls and bare wood. Particularly of note are two open hearths in the dining room, where the kitchen <a href="https://twitter.com/ZakaryPelaccio/status/334787515972190209/photo/1">roasts meat on a spit</a>. Besides the dining room, there is also a lounge outfitted with wingback chair and leather couches, and a private upstairs dining room. <br />
</p>]]>
		<![CDATA[<p>The focus here is on locally-grown and -foraged ingredients, more vegetables and "less fatty, less heavy" dishes. Among other things, that means they offer a vegetarian tasting menu alongside their regular tasting menu every night, both of which range from six to seven courses for $65 (which Pelaccio says is about half of what a comparable restaurant in the city would charge). There are also some a la carte items at the bar, and all of the menus change regularly to feature whatever ingredients are of the moment. A <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ha7w86jt2u8mpio/5.19.13%20menu%20VEG.docx">recent vegetarian menu</a> included dishes like ramp ragout, carrots in a maple sap glaze, and chocolate cremeaux with black walnuts. </p>

<p>There's also a focus on various house-fermented condiments and sauces, from vinegars and fish sauce to kimchi. These have even made their way into the bar program, which includes a variation on the pickleback that chases a shot of bourbon with a shot of house-made Worcestershire sauce. As of now the restaurant is only open for dinner Wednesday through Sunday, from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.</p>

<p>New York City is about to start seeing <a href="http://therealdeal.com/blog/2013/05/22/icsc-firehouse-subs-eyes-60-store-expansion-in-nyc/">a whole lot more of that fireman red:</a> Florida-based sandwich chain <strong>Firehouse Subs</strong> is eyeing serious NYC expansion, in the hopes of opening <strong>as many as 60 restaurants here in the next 10 years</strong>. According to The Real Deal, the company has already identified sites where they want franchisees to open up shop, including 25 in Manhattan. The plan especially targets Downtown Manhattan&#151;including the coming retail mall at the World Trade Center&#151;as well as Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. </p>

<p>The fast-casual chain was founded by a couple of firefightin' brothers in Jacksonville in 1994 and loves donating to firehouses near its restaurants. The chain has over 600 locations across the country but none up here&#151;yet.<br />

<p>Beloved Chicago-based coffee chain <strong>Intelligentsia</strong>&#151;with its cult-like following in the Windy City and L.A.&#151;opened <a href="https://twitter.com/IntelliNYC/status/336807499523055617">its first New York City location yesterday</a>. Located in a niche inside the lobby of the brand-new <strong>High Line Hotel</strong>, this is the chain's ninth store total, and <a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/05/new-intelligentsia-coffee-nyc-high-line-chelsea-coffee-roaster-expansion.html">according to Serious Eats</a>, it represents a big step in an aggressive national expansion planned for this year. The zinc bar has a custom espresso machine and pourover coffee <a href="https://twitter.com/IntelliNYC/status/337233125887324161">using the Kalita Wave</a> <del>method</del>, serving a selection of <a href=http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/content/direct-trade">direct trade</a> coffees. The location <a href="http://blog.zagat.com/2013/05/intelligentsia-now-open-in-high-line.html">also reportedly sells</a> baked goods from <strong>Mah Ze Dahr Bakery</strong>.</p>

<p>The coffee bar is eventually going to be even more integrated into the hotel's 118-year-old bones with both front and back courtyard seating, though those are both reportedly still in the works. It's open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., just steps from the Highline.<br />

On the entrees: "Pot-au-feu ($44, for two) becomes <b>pot-au-pho</b>, with cinnamon-clove aromas coming off the beef and intense marrow-spiked broth. It's loaded with oxtail richness and the <b>clean spank of Thai basil</b> that makes this hot soup okay for summer. Duck for two ($78) is code for <b>duck tacos</b>, thanks to buckwheat pancakes. Giant slabs of roasted breast meat give way to your knife with ease, while braised leg practically shreds itself after a good stare."  Sutton gives the restaurant <b>two stars</b>, with a special shout-out to Tien's sweet and salty fries. [Bloomberg]</p>

<p>As <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/05/the_goose_is_loose_wells_gives_zero_stars_to_beatrice_inn.php">noted</a> yesterday, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-beatrice-inn-in-the-west-village.html?partner=bloomberg&_r=1&"><b>Pete Wells</b> is not a fan of Graydon Carter's <b>The Beatrice Inn</b></a>: "Lamb porterhouse showered with roasted artichoke leaves was very satisfying once I ignored the <b>grainy, salty sauce</b> of dried black olives around it. So were crisp and fresh fried oysters with smoked char roe, as long as I didn't focus too much on a <b>bitter and blandly sweet citrus pur&eacute;e</b>."  <b>Goose egg</b>.  [NYT]</p>

<p><a href="http://observer.com/2013/05/golden-and-lavish-andrew-carmellinis-lafayette-is-the-great-gatsby-of-restaurants/2/"><b>Joshua David Stein</b> files on <b>Lafayette</b> this week</a>: "<b>Astute</b> is exactly how I would describe most of the food. Inspired? Not really. But smart and perceptive, certainly. Raclette, a cheese too often confined to blanketing potatoes, ennobles a very good <b>brisket burger</b> at lunch. Muscat grapes, like capers, are used to great effect, as in a perfectly prepared dorade, where they cameo in an update of sauce veronique, or at lunch, where they top little grilled shrimpies and are studded with capers."

		<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.insatiable-critic.com/Article.aspx?ID=1749&keyword=In%20the%20Nabes"><b>Gael Greene</b> files on two relatively new Upper East Side establishments: <b>83 1/2</b> and <b>Cocina Economica</b></a>.  On the former:  "The service alternates between friendly, effusive and <b>wrong table</b>, but that's forgivable given a lemony caponata, the familiar eggplant stew with pine nuts and raisins to pile on toast, and fricco, parmesan crisps that we're dragging through a thin 'aioli' of Calabrian chili and honey. Only the watery housemade ricotta with pesto disappoints. My friend finds her <b>Sicilian gimlet</b> with homemade limoncello pleasantly refreshing.  She gives me a sip. I agree." Ms. Gael not wowed by the Mexcian fare at Cocina Economica.  [Insatiable]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/05/platt-on-lafayette.html"><b>Adam Platt</b> gives <b>two stars</b> to <b>Lafayette</b></a>: "The small-plate toast dishes popularized by Jean-Georges at ABC Kitchen are called tartines here, and you can get them piled with spoonfuls of <b>opulent duck-liver mousse</b> ($8) or Selles-sur-Cher goat cheese, decked with tomatoes and slivers of fresh radish. My classic beef tartare ($18) was a much better deal than the mealy Hawaiian prawns ($19 with sauce verte), but if you're in the mood for serious feed, begin your dinner with the <b>lardon-rich salad fris&eacute;e,</b> which is served on a plate the size of a small hubcap."

<span class="credit">[Nightingale 9 by <a href="http://www.nycfoodphotographer.com/">Krieger</a>]</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/nightingale-9">Although she's not a fan of the decor, Ms. <b>Jordana Rothman</b> likes Robert Newton's take on Vietnamese fare at <b>Nightingale 9</b></a>: "The iconic Hanoi dish cha ca la vong&#8212;typically turmeric-blasted fish served with a pickler's pantry worth of dill&#8212;is served as a rice noodle bowl, with sprigs of the herb, crushed peanuts and <b>fingers of fried catfish</b> that might be equally at home at Seersucker, the American Southern restaurant Newton operates nearby. Peanuts and slippery vermicelli noodles also anchor the bun cha bowl, with patties of <b>charred Berkshire pork</b> and curls of belly meat, a chop of scallions and leaves of butter lettuce." <b>Three stars</b> out of five.

<p><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-05-22/restaurants/williamsburg-s-sweet-chick-revives-an-iconic-harlem-favorite/">In his last review for the <i>Village Voice</i>, <b>Robert Sietsema</b> recommends the signature dish at <b>Sweet Chick</b> in Williamsburg</a>: "The menu's bedrock is the venerable combo of <b>chicken and waffles</b>. This being the 'Burg, the fried chicken mimics the extensively brined product sold not far away at Pies 'n' Thighs, with a thickish crust and pillowy flesh. While my own preferences are for a dusting of flour and not brining the bird (making it chewier but more flavorful), I've got to admit Sweet Chick's product is <b>perfect of its type</b>."  Sietsema finds some duds on the appetizer and entree list.  [FitR]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-beatrice-inn-in-the-west-village.html?partner=bloomberg&_r=1&"><b>Pete Wells</b> had one good meal and several bad ones at Graydon Carter's <b>The Beatrice Inn</b></a>.  The good dinner was cooked by <b>Brian Nasworthy</b>, who left the restaurant in January.  Now the menu is full of clunkers: <blockquote>There was nothing to say about a stack of carrots that came with a braised and roasted veal breast except that <b>it shouldn't be possible for vegetables to be both charred and raw</b>. Apparently it is, though, because a steak turned up in the company of blackened and crunchy hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. The desperately undercooked sunchokes with saut&eacute;ed trout were something of a relief. <b>They were awful</b>, but they were not even a little bit burned.</blockquote>Wells gives the restaurant a zero star "satisfactory" rating.  And in case you're wondering, Brian Nasworthy is now at <b>Picholine</b>. <br />

But unlike his other ventures that have been exceptionally well received, this latest one in the area bordering Gowanus and Carroll Gardens is <a href="http://pardonmeforasking.blogspot.com/2013/05/rock-and-roll-playhouse-for-kiddies-or.html">running into trouble</a> from the get go. Shapiro and his team are hoping to convert a former warehouse into the <strong>Rock & Roll Playhouse</strong>, a venue that will host children's music classes during the day and then turn into a 21 and over music club starting at 8 p.m., with live music and a full restaurant and a late night curfew. </p>

<p>Neighbors are already starting to rally against the proposal, which they say is incompatible with the surrounding uses and will ruin the quality of the life for the people that live around the building. There are already <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/stop-the-development-of-the-rock-and-roll-playhouse-a-21-and-over-nightclub-in-residential-carroll-gardens-gowanus">various petitions </a>and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/We-Are-Gowanus/146583272193503?fref=ts">campaigns</a> against the project, and efforts by Shapiro's team to conduct outreach in advance of their liquor license application have not been well received. There will be more news to come when the project goes in front of Community Board 6 sometime in the next few months. <br />

That means no more Grub Street blogs in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston.  From <a href="http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2013/05/grub-street-announcement.html'">a post on Grub Street announcing the closures</a>: "This doesn't mean that Grub Street won't be covering these cities anymore: We'll continue to write about openings and other news from there and, indeed, the rest of the country."  <a href="https://twitter.com/skyfullofbacon/statuses/336890223298502656">Current</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyHighlife/status/336873332433633280">former</a> Grub Street editors first spread the news on Twitter.</p>

<p>When the third day of the second annual Brooklyn foodie shitshow <strong>The Great GoogaMooga</strong> was <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/05/googamooga_day_three_cancelled_due_to_weather.php">cancelled due to weather</a>, potential festival-goers were bummed, food vendors <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/05/googamooga_6.php">were pissed</a>, and pretty much everybody was cranky about all that wasted food. If there's any silver lining in this, it's that at least organizers <strong>Superfly</strong>&#151;while failing for a second year in a row to throw an uncontroversial food festival&#151;were at least <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Zi2PN5wLNX/#">able to get some of that food</a> into the hands of deserved charities, including the Food Bank for New York City. </p>

<p>Gothamist <a href="http://gothamist.com/2013/05/20/googamooga_1.php">gets a rundown</a> from City Harvest, which reportedly got 2,500 pounds of food out of the deal, but much, much more than that was wasted both during the chaos of the initial cancellation and because food banks are restricted in terms of what donations they can accept. And of course that will probably do little to allay the anger of food vendors, many of whom are, like <a href="https://twitter.com/BrindleRoom/status/336251036991905792">Brindle Room</a>, out well over $10,000, <strong>despite being told it was a "rain or shine" event.</strong> <br />
</p>]]>
		<![CDATA[<p>Unsurprisingly, many are beginning to question whether or not Superfly should try to bring the Not-So-Great GoogaMooga back for a third year. Grub Street, for one, argues that <a href="http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2013/05/googamooga-rained-out-why-bother-year-three.html">it's time for the Moog to give up the ghost</a>, noting that, in addition to the food waste and two disastrous years in a row, the festival simply isn't bringing anything unique to the New York dining scene. Add this to increasingly vocal critics citing concerns about using a public park for a for-profit event, which <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/a-curious-costbenefit-analysis-of-a-park-fund-raiser/">only brings in $75,000 at most</a> for the park, it might just not be worth it.</p>

<p>Event co-founder <strong>Jonathan Meyers</strong>, meanwhile, tells Gothamist that they need to assess this year's event before deciding whether or not to return. If it doesn't return, there's a definite precedent for that for Superfly: Despite the promoters' success with Bonnaroo and other festivals, it ran <strong>Vegoose</strong> in Las Vegas for just three years. A big part of that decision will likely be affected by whether or not Superfly's <a href="http://chicagoist.com/2013/05/19/great_googamooga_fest_coming_to_chi.php">GoogaMooga follow-up in Chicago</a> encounters similar issues. </p>

<p>Time will tell whether or not it returns, but for now everyone can do those vendors a solid by eating <em>everything</em>. Of note: <strong>Red Hook Lobster Pound</strong>'s truck <a href=https://twitter.com/Redhooklobster/status/336839791591161858">is in Midtown today</a> with $12 lobster rolls, while a whole slew of places, like P.J. Clarke's, OTB, Fedora, and others, <a href="https://twitter.com/Sea2Table/status/336854346962710528">are selling oysters</a> that went unsold on Sunday. Know of any other ongoing GoogaMooga-related deals? <a href="mailto:tips@eater.com">Send them to the tipline</a>.<br />
<strong>Update:</strong> Here's another one: <strong>Kasadela</strong> has extra Japanese-style wings from Sunday's cancellation, which they'll be selling at <strong>Vol de Nuit</strong> on West Fourth tonight starting at 8 p.m.<br />

Word on the street is that landlord <b>Peter Brant</b>, who also owns <i>Interview</i> magazine, plans to increase the rent by an "exorbitant amount," and that proprietor John McDonald might be forced to close the restaurant when the lease is up due to the extreme rent spike. </p>

<p>Lure attracts a steady stream of tech young guns, media power players, fashion world personalities, moguls, politicians, and celebrities &#8212; the kind of people that read, write, and appear in Brant's magazine.  McDonald has deep roots in the neighborhood, and his establishments are beloved by the people that live and work there. McDonald and Brant declined to comment on the rumors, but presumably, Brant's only motivation behind spiking the rent would be to get a business that is not a restaurant in this space.  It would be a shame to lose that dining room &#8212; it's a modern classic. </p>

<p>As a response the gossip, loyal customers <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23savelurefishbar&src=typd">started</a> a <b>#savelurefishbar</b> hashtag to show their solidarity with the restaurant.  Here's a glimpse at the outrage from the various power players that dine there:  </p>]]>

Coney Island institution <b>Nathan's Famous</b> is back in action.  The original Surf Avenue location of the hot dog emporium has been shuttered since Hurricane Sandy <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2012/11/nathans_sandy.php">caused severe damage</a> to the space.  But last night, the company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=523154407721328&set=a.120889251281181.8732.109841792385927&type=1&theater">posted a photo of the open restaurant on Facebook</a> with the note "Isn't it a beautiful sight?"  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nathansfamous.com/posts/522643104439125?comment_id=82798460&offset=0&total_comments=2">Another note</a> on Facebook explains that the restaurant reopened its doors at 7 p.m. last night.  </p>]]>
		<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://brooklyn.ny1.com/content/top_stories/182254/storm-damaged-nathan-s-ready-for-summer-crowds">When asked about the storm, director of operations Bruce Miller recently told NY1</a>: "When I drove up I was <b>flabbergasted by the extent of the damage</b>, the whole restaurant was completely flooded out." The layout of the dining room is slightly different now, and the Nathan's team added a new clam bar which serves oysters &#8212; a first for the restaurant.  The space <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/05/nathans_2.php">caught on fire earlier this month</a>, but the blaze did not cause any significant delays.  The other Nathan's location directly on the boardwalk <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/03/nathans_1.php">reopened at the end of March</a>.  </p>

<p>In Eater's <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/05/restaurants_tthat_are_still_closed_because_of_sandy.php">latest survey of the restaurants that remain closed because of Sandy</a>, many restaurateurs said they planned to reopen by Memorial Day. Hopefully there will be more reopening announcements by the end of the week. <br />

Jones and his lawyer explained that the proposed location of Soho House at 139 Ludlow Street would be an asset to the community, and that they have a track record for being good neighbors.  In their pitch, Jones and his lawyer also noted that they would be happy to close the rooftop outdoor space at midnight and dedicate the basement space to "community use."  Although many people spoke in favor of supporting their liquor license application, the ultimate decision from the Community Board was to <b>deny the license</b>.  But it was a nail biter: six members supported the decision do deny, four members voted against the decision, and one member abstained.  </p>

<p>Many of the people that spoke against Soho House at last night's cramped, sweaty CB 3 meeting argued that the block that the building sits on is simply over-saturated with liquor licenses, and that any additional club &#8212; even an upscale one &#8212; would contribute to ongoing quality of life issues.  Supporters of Soho House &#8212; of which there were many, including one <b>Michael Chernow</b> &#8212; argued that having an establishment like this on Ludlow Street would be a good thing for the neighbors.  A lot of people that spoke in favor mentioned that members use the club for business meetings, and that it would bring foot traffic to the area during the day.  The conversation about Soho House lasted for over two hours, but ultimately, the team got shut down. The full board will vote on this issue at the end of the month.  </p>]]>
		<![CDATA[<p>As several people noted at last night's meeting, the State Liquor Authority up in Albany will probably give Soho House the liquor license no matter what, because the owners are making a huge investment in the area, and money talks.  One CB member remarked: "<b>To think that Albany is going to turn this down is naive</b>...They own the building...and it's an eight million dollar investment." </p>

<p>In other liquor license news, the Community Board 3 voted to deny <b>The Living Room</b> team's application at 173 East Second Street.  The owners of the singer-songwriter club want to move it to an old laundromat space a few blocks north once their lease is up, but the CB 3 made a motion to deny because of a zoning restriction in the area. <br />

<a href="http://eater.com/archives/2013/05/20/the-franks-unveil-res-a-new-chef-artist-residency-in-brooklyn.php">At the M&eacute;samerica Festival in Mexico City today, <b>Frank Castronovo</b> and <b>Frank Falcinelli</b> of Frankies and Prime Meats</a> made an official announcement <a href="http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/04/the_franks_1.php">about their new Red Hook project</a>, <b>RES</b>.  The Franks hope to create an "<b>artist residency for chefs</b>," where visiting chefs can cook for the locals and collaborate.  Falcinelli explained: <blockquote>At the space, we can host collaborative dinners, one-off events, and installations, and the <b>chefs can stay at the facility while they present their work</b>, free of charge. It's a place where a chef can present their work exactly how they want it to be, while exploring the city, meeting colleagues, and working on their repertoire.</blockquote>Castronovo said that this should open "<b>in a few short weeks</b>."  Head over to Eater National for an excerpt from today's announcement, and check out the RES site <a href="http://resresres.com/">here</a>. <br />
